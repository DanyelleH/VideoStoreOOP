This file shows my initial thoughts while reading through the readme to get an idea of the layout.
Throughout the project I've made comments as i went to show where changes/improvements in this process were made.

Pseudocode:
Classes:
    -Customers
        import csv
    -Invetory
        import csv

     - Video Store
        def access_invetory(self):
            return title and available_copies

        def view_all_customers self:
            return customer_id and first_name , last_name

        def customers_current_rentals(customer_id as input,)
            return the names of the movies rented by the user, seperated by the "/".
    
        def new_customer()
            take in infoo to write into the csv file at the end, generating an id +1 of the previous customer.
                to prevent a duplicate id, should the id be a private variable?
    
        def rent_video(video_title, Customer_id):
            check if the customer has reacher their maximum rentals.
            if not, add that title to their current rentals, and decrement the numer of copies available in the inventory.
                if account type = sx:
                    if current rentals length > 0:
                        proceed 
                    else:
                        upgrade account or return previous movie.
                if account type px:
                    if current_rentals <3:
                        proceed
                    else:
                        return a movie.

        def return_video(video_title, customer_id):
            increment the invetory for the video title, remove the title from the customers rentals.
                    
        def available_movies(self):
            returns title and copies available.
